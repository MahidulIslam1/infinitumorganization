                <p>Originally hailing from first-generation immigrant families, the founders of The Study Zone understand how particularly integral education is to students and how much tutoring could stand to benefit children of low socio-economic backgrounds. 
                    With this in mind, Mincheng Jin, Shah Najib, and Rohan Tonmoy worked on establishing The Study Zone in the summer of 2022. As Bronx Science students, this trio passed the difficult SHSAT exam, regardless of their low socio-economic backgrounds, and credit their success to tutoring sessions and deliberate hard work. After realizing how important of a part tutoring played in their academic achievement, the trio decided the way to help others was by setting up a free-of-charge tutoring system to help elevate those from low socio-economic backgrounds.
                    Tonmoy in particular, also wanted to emphasize the value of having a mentor as a role model for younger students who may not have one. Tonmoy discussed how his role model, his cousin, guided him throughout highschool, specifically the importance of studying. Finding this instruction particularly useful, Tonmoy believes that the mentorship TheStudyZone provides would be extremely beneficial to its tutees, who may have trouble finding an experienced mentor with the ability to help them through their academic careers. 
                    TheStudyZone offers Common Core, SAT, and SHSAT tutoring to the targeted audience of those from low-economic backgrounds. So far, they have accumulated a vast amount of experienced tutors, many hailing from Bronx Science and specializing in certain fields such as mathematics and english. With their experienced group of tutors, TheStudyZone is able to provide quality prep for free to their numerous tutees.
                    With this being said, if you would like quality tutoring in the various subjects and exams mentioned, TheStudyZone is the organization to consult for free tutoring. Furthermore, if you would like to volunteer as a tutor alongside a professional and punctual team while gaining service hours, TheStudyZone would be the perfect destination for you.
